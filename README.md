###Burrows-Wheeler Transform 

> The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) algorithm is commonly used in data compression. 
> It doesn't compress data on its own, but it is the first step in transforming a given text into a string 
> where repeated characters in that string are grouped together. 
> The transformed string is more amenable to compression with the use of other compression algorithms.
